# Important Notes
Right now, the code for Lab 2 is in the BUILD_DIR folder, in the file named ```main.c```


# Usage
1. Rename your .c file to ```main.c``` and drop it in in ```./BUILD_DIR```
2. From the root folder, (this one, known as ```./```), run the command listed in ```build.txt``` (I will make this a script at some point)
3. The output will appear in a subfolder of ```./build``` (I'll check exactly which one some other time).



Right now, the command *should* be as follows:

```scons build/esos_embeddedF14_33EP512GP806/BUILD_DIR/main.hex```
