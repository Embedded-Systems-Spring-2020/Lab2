# Important Notes
Right now, the code for Lab 2 is in the BUILD_DIR folder, in the files named ```t2_rag1.c```, ```t2_rag2.c```, ```t2_rag3.c```


# Usage
1. Navigate to the folder that contains ```SConstruct.py``` and run the command listed in ```build.txt```, for each file to be compiled. Example, to compile ```t2_rag1.c```, the command should be ```scons build/esos_embeddedF14_33EP512GP806/BUILD_DIR/t2_rag1.hex```
3. The output will appear in a subfolder of ```build```.


Right now, the command *should* be as follows:

```scons build/esos_embeddedF14_33EP512GP806/BUILD_DIR/[NAME OF FILE TO COMPILE HERE].hex```
